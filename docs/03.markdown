Choose an Executor
------------------

Dispatch supports arbitrarily many types of HTTP *executors*—you could
make your own, and you wouldn't be the first to do so. Executors carry
out your request *handlers* and *callbacks*.

Because executors are defined separately from HTTP interaction,
you can model HTTP interaction without demanding a particular
implementation. For example, the same interface to a web API can be
used with an NIO executor and a Google App Engine executor.

Dispatch includes several executors, defined in various modules and
packages. These executors are all called "Http", so application code
typically imports only the base `dispatch` package and refers to
executors by their subpackage name, as seen below.

> To follow along with the examples below, use a console of the Twine
  example app described in the preceding page.

### Current Thread Blocking (dispatch-http)

The traditional and most common Dispatch executor is located in the
base `dispatch` package. It performs its operations in the current
program thread, allowing it to return whatever value the handler
builds. If you request a string response body with `as_str`, the
executor's return type is `String`.

    import dispatch._
    val h = new Http
    h(url("http://www.scala-lang.org/") as_str)

You may notice in the Scala console that the last expression above
reports a return type of `HttpPackage`. This wrapping type is required
to generalize the executor model, but in this executor it is defined
as the wrapped type itself. It can be used any place where the wrapped
type is expected.

    val s: String = h(url("http://www.scala-lang.org/") as_str)

An important caveat of the executor defined above is that it is not
thread-safe. You should not share references to it across
threads. Instead, Dispatch applications commonly define a function in
some convenient object that returns a newly constructed executor. This
also allows you replace it with a customized executor, later.

    def http = new Http

Another option is to use a thread-safe executor, which maintains a
shared connection pool and may (or may not) provide better
performance. Dispatch provides a trait for this behavior:

    val http = new Http with thread.Safety

The `Http` singleton object is an executor constructed with this
trait, so you can use it from any thread.

    Http(url("http://www.scala-lang.org/") as_str)

### Background Thread Blocking (dispatch-http)

Another executor that does not depart from the traditional model is
the background thread executor.

    import dispatch._
    val h = new thread.Http
    val f = h(url("http://www.scala-lang.org/") as_str)

This executor application evaluates to a *future* for the string value
to be constructed by the handler. A future in Dispatch is a function.

    type Future[T] = Function0[T] {
      def isSet: Boolean
    }

When applied, the future waits until its underlying value is
available, and `isSet` reports this availability. These are useful
when handling a batch of requests, for example.

    val urls: Traversable[String] = < some urls I need to get >
    val futures = urls.map { u => h(url(u) as_str) }

    < do something else that's slow... >

    val (ready, working) = futures.partition { _.isSet }
    consume(ready.map { _() }) // mapped to Traversable[String]

### Native I/O (dispatch-nio)

This executor uses Java NIO and does not block a current or background
thread while carrying out requests. You can have *n* active requests
without tying up *n* threads or waiting for available threads from a
pool.

    import dispatch._
    val h = new nio.Http
    val f = h(url("http://www.scala-lang.org/") as_str)

Like the background thread executor, the NIO executor returns a
Dispatch future; you can operate on collection as in the previous
example. One caveat of this executor is that it must be shutdown.

    h.shutdown()

If you're using this executor in a console and forget to shut it down,
the console may not close when asked.

### Google App Engine (dispatch-gae)

This executor operates on the current thread, like `dispatch.Http`,
but it is specially modified to work with Google App Engine which
does not permit the direct use of sockets.

    import dispatch._
    val h = new gae.Http
    val s = h(url("http://www.scala-lang.org/") as_str)

Note that this executor is not on Twine's classpath and should only be
used with App Engine.
