Who's Using Dispatch?
---------------------

These are some projects and companies that have used Dispatch.

#### conscript

[conscript](https://github.com/n8han/conscript) uses Dispatch to fetch
program descriptors from github.

#### giter8

[giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) uses Dispatch to fetch
templates from github.

#### posterous-sbt

The [posterous-sbt](https://github.com/n8han/posterous-sbt) plugin
uses Dispatch to publish project release notes.

#### Unfiltered

[Unfiltered](http://unfiltered.databinder.net/) uses Dispatch in its
system tests.

#### Novus

Dispatch forms the foundation of an in-house SOAP client at [Novus](https://www.novus.com/) together with [scalaxb](http://scalaxb.org/). Thanks to these tools our standard response to "Can you do SOAP?" is "Bring it on!" instead of "Ew, what's this on my shoe?!"

#### MLB.com

In a past life, [maxaf](https://github.com/maxaf) wrote an internal baseball stats REST API client that was used to feed data into some very gruelling PDF generation code. Dispatch was used to cleanly produce HTTP requests & parse responses without hurting engineer morale.
