Try Dispatch
------------

### Getting a Console

The simplest way to try Dispatch is to clone the Twine example
application from github.

    git clone https://github.com/n8han/dispatch-twine.git

> If you don't have git available, you can download and extract the
project's current
[zip archive](https://github.com/n8han/dispatch-twine/zipball/master).

Twine is built with sbt 0.10. If you haven't yet [setup sbt][sbt], now
is a good time to do that. Once you have `sbt` on your executable search
path, you can enter its interactive console for the Twine project.

    cd dispatch-twine
    sbt

In sbt's console, call the `console` task.

    console

On the first run this task will download Dispatch dependencies and
compile the Twine app. After that, you should see a message welcoming
you to the console and a friendly `scala>` prompt.

### Your First Request

First, import the main Dispatch classes and objects into scope.

```scala
import dispatch._
```
Then, we'll need an HTTP *executor* to carry out our requests.

```scala
val h = new Http
```
Requests are described with `dispatch.Request` objects, and one way to
construct them is with a URL.

```scala
val req = url("http://www.scala-lang.org/")
```
This works because you've imported an object called `url` from the
`dispatch` package, and the object is itself a function that creates
request objects.

Now, we have an executor and a request. Dispatch needs to know how to
handle the request.

```scala
val handler = req >>> System.out
```
With this complete request-response handler, Dispatch can execute the
request. Assuming you have a network connection, that is.

```scala
h(handler)
```
And that was the source of the Scala home page. Of course, we don't
usually assign all these component parts to values unless we need to
reuse them. Typically, the handler above would be written in one line.

```scala
h(url("http://www.scala-lang.org/") >>> System.out)
```
