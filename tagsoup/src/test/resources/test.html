    <p><b>Apes</b> are Old World anthropoid mammals, more specifically a clade of tailless catarrhine primates,
        belonging to the biological superfamily <b>Hominoidea</b>. The apes are native to Africa and South-east Asia,
        although in relatively recent times <a href="/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a> have spread all over the world.
        Apes are the world's largest primates; the orangutan, an ape, is the world's largest living arboreal animal.
        Hominoids are traditionally forest dwellers, although chimpanzees may range into savanna, and the extinct
        australopithecines are famous for being savanna inhabitants, inferred from their morphology. Humans inhabit
        almost every terrestrial habitat.</p>
    <p>Hominoidea contains two families of living (extant) species:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hylobatidae consists of four genera and sixteen species of gibbon, including the lar gibbon and the siamang.
            They are commonly referred to as lesser apes.</li>
        <li>Hominidae consists of orangutans, gorillas, common chimpanzees, bonobos and humans. Alternatively, the
            hominidae family are collectively described as the great apes.</li>
    </ul>
